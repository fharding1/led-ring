For a dimmer LED ring (if you're not switching the ring on and off via a relay), 120 Ohm resistors can be used for 20mA LED current (instead of 30mA), or 270 Ohm for 10mA. Play around with [ledcalc.com](http://ledcalc.com/) (12v supply voltage, 3.2v LED voltage drop, 30mA desired LED current, 24 LEDs).
